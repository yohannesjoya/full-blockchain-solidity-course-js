Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts and enables developers to create decentralized applications (dapps). Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether.

Bitcoin has a very limited scripting language and is not designed to be programmed for anything else than peer-to-peer money.

Ethereum's language is designed to execute arbitrary code and enable developers to create all kinds of applications on top of blockchain technology.

Ethereum is sometimes described as a world computer because it uses blockchain technology as a global data storage, that can store code and data, and execute programs on one globally distributed machine. This virtual computer, whose state all participants in the network share is called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Because the execution of programs and storing of data on Ethereum must be done by all the nodes in the network, performing computational tasks and making changes to the state of the data needs to be paid for to prevent abuse. Computational work is measured in Gas and is paid in Ether. Changes in the state are submitted via transactions.

The idea of Ethereum is to apply the benefits of blockchain technology to code and applications in general. Enabling developers to create applications with built-in economic functions that are transparent, immutable (unchangeable), and accessible.

But like Bitcoin, Ethereum struggles among other things with, energy efficiency, high transaction costs, and poor user experience.
