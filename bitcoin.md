Bitcoin (BTC, â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency. Bitcoins can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. The transactions are verified and stored by the nodes of the network in a distributed public ledger (record of transactions) called the blockchain.

Bitcoin consists of three main components:

Bitcoin the currency (BTC)
Like fiat (government-issued) and other money, Bitcoin can be considered a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange.
In contrast to fiat money, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are digital money that is not administered by any central entity and is not reliant on a third party to make transactions.
That's why Bitcoin is an "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" (Satoshi Nakamoto, 2008).

The bitcoin network
The bitcoin network facilitates Bitcoin transactions. It is a peer-to-peer payment network that operates on a cryptographic protocol.

The Bitcoin Core software
The bitcoin network consists of nodes, that run the Bitcoin Core software. Bitcoin Core is a free open source software that is not owned by any single entity, or cooperation. It is maintained by an open global community of software developers.

Because there is no central authority:

Nobody can inflate the limited supply of 21 million Bitcoin.
No one can seize somebody's Bitcoin.
No need for a bank account to participate in global commerce.
Global transfers are theoretically fast and cheap.
But with high energy and transaction costs, regulatory uncertainty, and often poor user experience, Bitcoin also faces some challenges.
